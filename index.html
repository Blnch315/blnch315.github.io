        This website contains the information on how to refine from 0 to S.<br>
        I will also share my trick on refining B-S with my full research on how I came up with that trick.

        <h2>Refining 0-B</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>In refining 0-B you'll need a full Tech character to have the maximum success rate and maxed the level of all refining skills, the cheapest way to refine is by:</h3>
            1.) Using Mithril Ore from 0-E;<br>
            2.) Then Mithril Ore with Anti-Degradation for E-C; <br>
            3.) Next refine to C-B using Orichalcum and Anti-Degradation.<br>

            Mithril Ore can be farmed at Ultimea: Southeast, the Underground Nemicos are the mob for the drop.<br>
            Orichalcums can be bought at General Stores for 16,000 spina per piece quite pricey.
        </p>
        <h3>Q: Isn't it more cheaper if I refine with Orichalcum from D-B instead of Mithril Ore?</h3>
        <p>A: It is not, the Orichalcum might do higher success rate starting from D-B. 
            But 1 refine of Orichalcum with Anti-Degradation is almost the same as refining 5 Mithril Ore with Anti-Degradation.
            The stakes of refining with Mithril Ore with Anti-Degradation is more favorable cause it is also likely for Orichalcum to fail
            even though the success rate is higher. It is better to fail in refining with Mithril Ores, than with Orichalcums.

        <h2>Refining B-S</h2>
        <p>
            In refining B-S your character must have full luck 255, and you only need Lv 1 Refiner Skill.<br>
            You can use different refining materials since the success rate is always the same ranging from hematite ore to orichalcum.<br>
            I recommend using mithril ore with anti-degradation throughout the whole process of refining, cause it is currently the cheapest and the easiest refining material to farm.<br>
            There are a few things that are important to know. <br>
            <h3>1.) Weapon must be non-slotted</h3>
            <h4>Q: Is it possible to refine 1 Slotted and 2 Slotted weapons from B-S?</h4>
            <p>A: Yes it is possible, the degradation chances are the same for whatever weapons, but the rank of degradation is different</p>
            Non-slotted weapons can only degrade with a maximum of 1 rank. (ex. from 3 to 2)<br>
            1 Slotted weapons can degrade with a maximum of 2 ranks. (ex. from 3 to 1)<br>
            2 Slotted weapons can degrade with a maximum of 3 ranks. (ex. from 3 to 0)<br><br>

            It would be annoying to refine higher slotted weapons and might cost you more than you think.<br>
            Estimatedly, you might end up spending 7M spina for +S 1 slotted, and 10M spina for +S 2 slotted, or worst more than that.<br>
            It would be mathematically cheaper to just start refining from non-slotted, then buy piercers from players.
            <h3>2.) Luck doesn't increase success rate</h3>
            Luck increases the anti-degradation rate by a lot and not the success rate. It is said that with the use of Anti-Degradation(75%), the rate with pure luck character will rise up to 99%
            <h3>3.) 99% is not 100%</h3>
            Even though anti-degradation rate is 99%, degradation will still happen more often than successul +S refine. I've read that the success rate for +A and +S are both 0.001%
            which means that it's normal to have more degradation than success.
