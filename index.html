        This website contains the information on how to refine from 0 to S.<br>
        I will also share my trick on refining B-S with my full research on how I came up with that trick.

        <h2>Refining 0-B</h2>
        <p>
            In refining 0-B, the cheapest way to refine is by:<br>
            1.) Using Mithril Ore from 0-E;<br>
            2.) Then Mithril Ore with Anti-Degradation for E-C; <br>
            3.) Next refine to C-B using Orichalcum and Anti-Degradation.<br>

            Mithril Ore can be farmed at Ultimea: Southeast, the Underground Nemicos are the mob for the drop<br>
            Orichalcums can be bought at General Stores for 16,000 spina per piece quite pricey.
        </p>
        <h3>Q: Isn't it more cheaper if I refine with Orichalcum from D-B instead of Mithril Ore?</h3>
        <p>A: It is not, the Orichalcum might do higher success rate starting from D-B. 
            But 1 refine of Orichalcum with Anti-Degradation is almost the same as refining 5 Mithril Ore with Anti-Degradation.
            The stakes of refining with Mithril Ore with Anti-Degradation is more favorable cause it is also likely for Orichalcum to fail
            even though the success rate is higher. It is better to fail in refining with Mithril Ores, than with Orichalcums.
